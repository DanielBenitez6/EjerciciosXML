1. ERROR: The <president> and <secretary> elements are declared outside the <company> element.
   CORRECTION: Move them inside each respective <company> block.

2. ERROR: Tags are incorrectly nested. Example:
   <president>Bill Gates <extension>09-9990011</president></extension>
   CORRECTION: You cannot start <extension> inside <president> and close it outside.
   SOLUTION: Wrap the presidentâ€™s name in a <name> tag, and properly close both <name> and <extension> tags inside <president>.

3. ERROR: The same nesting issue happens with <secretary> elements.
   CORRECTION: Use <name> inside <secretary> and close <extension> properly.

4. ERROR: Structurally, having <president> and <secretary> outside <company> breaks the hierarchy.
   CORRECTION: Include all related info (exchange, president, secretary) within the same <company>.

5. SUGGESTION: Use consistent indentation and line breaks for better readability.

6. SUGGESTION: Use self-descriptive elements for clarity, e.g., <name> within <president> and <secretary>.
